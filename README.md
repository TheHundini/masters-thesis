This project is created as a part of a masters thesis written at Oslomet - University

This is still a work in progress but the point of the project is this:
- Make a tool that allowes easy testing of different asymmetric encryption algorithms
  - For Encryption this will be done through modification of TLS1.3
  - For Signatures this will be done through a JWT payload.
